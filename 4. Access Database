Task 4: Access Your Local Database via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

In this task, you will start Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the SQL Server database that is running locally on the EC2 instance.

In the remote session:
Choose the Windows start  icon
Search for SQL Server Management Studio by typing 
ssms
In the search results, choose Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17
SQL Server Management Studio will take a few minutes to launch.

After SQL Server Management Studio launches, configure:
Server name:
Select <Browse for more...>
Under Database Engine, select the engine that you see
Choose OK
Choose Connect
This connects you to the local instance of SQL Server on your instance using Windows Authentication.

In Object Explorer:
Expand Databases

Expand Tables

A sample AdventureWorks database has been loaded onto the local database as part of the lab setup. Examine the tables and the data.

In the next task, you will copy this data to the Amazon RDS database.
