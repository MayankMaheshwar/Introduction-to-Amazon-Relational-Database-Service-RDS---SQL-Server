In the Connectivity section, configure:
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Lab VPC

Here you will be able to monitor the progress of your DB Instance. The RDS instance will take about 20 minutes to create. However, as part of the lab setup, a similar RDS instance ("Lab") was automatically provisioned to expedite the lab. The rest of the steps will use this pre-created instance.
